    <p>PDX Games.js is a hackathon for all those who are working on games in JS. This could be browser games, nodejs games, or any other game powered primarily by JS. We will hack until there is 1 hour left and then we will do presentations. Bring your preexisting game that you are working on or come and start a new one. You should bring a system that you can hack on, as well as having a project in mind to work on even if you haven't started it.</p>
